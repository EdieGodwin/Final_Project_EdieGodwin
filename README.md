# Final_Project_EdieGodwin
Here is a very broad, general overveiw of what I plan to do for my final project. I had trouble picking a topic but I think I found one that is both important to me and should lend itself well to different data visualizations: gentrification.
# Final Project #
Gentrification is characterized by a low-income area beginning to conform to middle-class tastes. Generally gentrification brings increased property values and investment to a neighborhood. While this is not inherently bad, the connotation of gentrification focuses on what happens when it is done poorly. Without the proper policies in place, gentrification can lead to the residents of a neighborhood being pushed out to other low-income areas for middle-class (typically white) families to take their place.

Here in Pittsburgh, residents often point to the Lawrenceville neighborhood as the poster-child for gentrification. The area was built by low-income, diverse, working families into a very interesting, eclectic neighborhood. In the last decade or so, it has been that unique vibe that attracted investment and interest to the neighborhood.

I’m interested in seeing if Lawrenceville has been a victim of gentrification or if the city did a reasonably good job in protecting the citizens of Lawrenceville. I’ll do this by comparing census data from 2011 with the most recent data, 2017, for median home values, median incomes and demography. 
## The Story ##
Starting with what gentrification is and looks like and explaining the salience of the three metrics I'm looking at, I'll move into comparing data from 2011 to data from 2017 for zip codes 15201 and 15224. I would like to present some distributions and maps to show the differences between 2011 and 2017 Lawrenceville. If available, it would be interesting to see migration patterns of families who came to or left Lawrenceville, but that data may not be available.
Depending on the findings from the data I would like to sugegst that people either look to Lawrenceville as an example or a cautionary tale. Gentrification doesn't always have to be bad, so there is a very real chance that locals just don’t like the recent changes to the neighborhood.  
## The Data ##
To create compelling points and data visualizations I will pull from American Fact Finder.

## Method and Medium ##
Using colors from the Lawrenceville website, seen here: http://lvpgh.com/, I will create infographics and graphs using a mix of Excel, RawGraphs and Canva. I would like to create maps using ArcGis to show the variations in home values or incomes, whatever would be the most impactful on a map. Maps will be helpful because they will provide the reader with more context than would otherwise be possible.
I will present my project using Shorthand. Their smooth scrolling will be conducive to the flow of my story and the format will allow me to frame the story without having to touch a powerpoint 

## User Research Protocol: ## 
_Target Audience:_ Community Groups/ Citizen Action Orgs.  
_Identifying Individuals to Interview:_ A local community group meets at the public library on Saturdays and several Lawrenceville residents go to my gym. Both groups would be open to looking at and critiquing my planning documents.  
_Interview Script:_
1.  What do you think the point of this graph/chart is?  
2.  What tells you that (their response) is the point of the graph/chart?  
3.  What tone is conveyed by the color palette used? What do these colors remind you of or make you feel?  
4.  How would you use this graph/chart?

## Findings ##  
I presented my sketches to four people and below I have summarized the responses that I got for each sketch.  

### Median Household Income (2011 v. 2017) ###  
1.  Everyone who saw it understood that it was a comparison of median household income and that it had increased from 2011 to 2017.  
2.  It had a “clear title” and “is a simple graph”  
3.  The colors used gave it a positive feeling- influencing what people answered next:  
4.  Most people said they would use this graph to show that Lawrenceville is doing better now than it was and that they might show this to potential commercial investors  

### Change in Demographic Composition from 2011 to 2017 ###
1.  People had to look at this one longer to understand what it is, but they all came to understand it on their own. (Some people would ask why it started in the center but then would see that it is a % change)  
2.  Again, this one has a clear title, but most people wanted the demographic categories spelled out, not just represented by one or two letters.  
3.  People liked the colors for this one because they made it very easy to distinguish one column from another.  
4.  Half thought they might use this to give background and context for Lawrenceville, the other half was unsure of a specific way to use it but said they did think it could be useful.  

### Median Home Value (2011 v. 2017) ###
1.  All respondents looked at this one the longest and were unsure of the conclusion they came to (even though it was correct, they weren’t confident in their answer)  
2.  Again, respondents were unsure in their answer, telling me that the average person is not as comfortable reading a distribution as I assumed they would be.  
3.  No real comment on tone, mostly that it looks cheerful.  
4.  People were unsure of how to use this outside of a paper.  

## Changes Implemented: ##  

### Median Household Income (2011 v. 2017) ###  
Because we’re talking about gentrification and displacement of low-income families, I changed the colors here to be a little darker for a more serious tone.  
### Change in Demographic Composition from 2011 to 2017 ###  
No changes made.  
### Median Home Value (2011 v. 2017) ###  
This one I changed to be a bar graph, something that I think most people are more familiar with and can understand faster than they could the distributions.
